# CSS & Javascript

### Where stuff goes
- We put css and javascript files in the `/public` folder, not the `/assets` folder as is the norm with most Rails apps.
- We put external css and js in the `/public/vendor` folder. We create a folder for each library and name the file according to the version (for example `/public/vendor/htmx/1.9.9.js`).
- Most of our styling goes into `/public/stylesheets/styles.css`.
