# H1 Rails

H1 Rails (HTML First Rails) is a boilerplate for building polished web apps with minimal complexity. It's built for:
 
### Who It's For
- **Existing Rails Developers** who want *even more* simplicity, and more batteries included (solutions to common UI & UX challenges).
- **Developers new to Rails** as the most approachable way to explore Ruby & Rails ideas without getting bogged down in some of the areas with a high learning curve (Import maps, Hotwire, Stimulus).
 

### Enhancements
- H1 Rails has out-of-the-box support for common UI patterns like modals, toasts, tooltips, forms and other UI patterns, powered primarily by [Base Styles](https://github.com/reallygoodsoftware/base-styles). 

### Simplifications

- **No Build**: By default, we store CSS and javascript libraries in the `/public` folder. This removes an entire category of debugging & deployment complexity. 
- **HTMX instead of Hotwire**: We have found the abstractions in HTMX to be a better fit than Hotwire for many use cases. We also have several best practices docs for how to achieve common UX patterns using HTMX (multi step forms, type to search, etc.)



## Documentation & Demos

- Documentation is available at [h1rails.com](https://h1rails.com).
