Toasts use Rails\` Flash message functionality to send toasts from the backend to the frontend.

### To trigger a toast

```ruby
flash.now[:toasts] = [
  { title: 'Post Created', message: 'Your post has been created.' }
]
```

## Info

* Toast styling comes from base-styles.

* The html lives in `/views/shared/_partial_containers.html.erb` and `/views/shared/_toast.html.erb`.
