* Modals are remote by default. This means you load a modal with a normal link or `<a>` tag, and the content is loaded from a remote url.

## General Use

* Create a new route for your modal content.

```ruby
get "/account/info"  => "account#info", as: "my_path"
```

* Then load the modal with a normal link or `<a>` tag.

```erb
<a href="<%= my_path %>">Open Modal</a>
```

Or using the `link_to` Rails Helper.

```erb
<%= link_to 'Open Modal', my_path %>
```

Finally, add a before\_action to your controller to tell it to render in a modal.

```ruby
before_action :renders_in_modal, only: :info
```

## Slow Modals

If your modal loads fast, the above code is all you need. If it's going to take more than half a second to load, it's useful to show the loading skeleton when it's clicked.

```erb
<a :click="modalOpen=true" href="<%= my_path(modal:true) >" >Show</a>
```

## Pre Loaded Modals

Sometimes, you may want to load the modal content when the page itself loads. You can do this with content\_for in your view.

```erb
<% content_for :modal_content do |content| %>
  Special Offer!
<% end %>
```

With the content loaded in, you could now, for example, show a modal popup 2 seconds after the page loads.

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  MiniJS.window.modalOpen=true
}, "1000");
```

## Multi Step Forms and Links Inside Modals

Sometimes you may want to include links or forms in a modal, where subsequent pages/states load into the same modal. All you have to do here is make sure the controller actions being linked to or submitted also have the `renders_in_modal` before\_action.

## Under The Hood

* A hidden modal dialog div is loaded on every page. It's hooked in to Mini Js, so showing it is as easy as setting `modalOpen` to `true`.

* You can do this from the console with `MiniJS.window.modalOpen=true`, or you can use a Mini event on any element, like so.

```
<button :click="modalOpen=true">Show</button>
```

That said, the above method is mainly useful for debugging and is not the standard way to show a modal.
