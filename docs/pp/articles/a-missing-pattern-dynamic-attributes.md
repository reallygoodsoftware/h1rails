# DUSS: Dom Updates Based on Simple State

## A Common Pattern

When building user interfaces on the web, there's a class of problem that is extremely common which goes something along the lines of:&#x20;

**When a user interacts with Element (usually clicks), update a property (usually class) on the Element (or some other element), based on some simple logic.**

For example, to build a simple custom dropdown, you might specify...

**When a user clicks on the dropdown button, toggle the .visible class on the drawer**

For a left sidebar or tab navigation, you might specify...

**When a user clicks on a menu item, set the class to active, and remove the active class from all other menu items**

For an accordion...

**When a user clicks on a drawer title, toggle \`.active\` on the content div, and remove \`.active\` on the other content divs.**



## Not Just Classes

While the most common use case is to toggle a class, there are other common patterns:

* Toggle the text in this span when the value of this form input changes.
* Toggle the value of this hidden form input when the value of this other form input changes.
