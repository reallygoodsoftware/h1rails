## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's HTML First?" defaultOpen={false}>
    HTML First is a style of writing web software that favours using the native capabilities and languages of the browser and reducing layers of abstraction (languages and toolchains) on top of them. You can read more about it here.

  <Accordion title="How does H1 Rails differ from normal Rails?" defaultOpen={false}>
    In H1 Rails, you don't need to know anything about Turbo Frames, Turbo Streams, Stimulus Controllers, Targets, Actions, Propshaft, or the asset pipeline. You'll need to learn a little bit of Ruby, but we largely treat Rails as an html container.

    [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) is disabled by default. Instead the app is [boosted](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-boost/) by htmx. This means you can just use normal rails `link_to` and `form_for` tags, and the app will handle smooth page transitions.

    You can of course turn on Turbo, Stimulus if you would prefer to keep them.

  <Accordion title="Why would I use H1 Rails?" defaultOpen={false}>
    You might use H1 Rails if...

    * You want a quick, simple boilerplate for building web apps.

    * You’re interested in the html-over-the-wire approach for its conceptual simplicity, but want a quicker way to dive in than learning Turbo and Stimulus.

    * You already know Rails, and have heard about the promise of HTMX and the Hypertext approach.

    * You’ve seen some of the examples of what can be built with it
