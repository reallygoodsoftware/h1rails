# Core

H1 Rails (HTML First Rails) is a boilerplate for building slick, polished web apps.

* **Low Floor, High Ceiling**: Extremely easy for beginners to get started with minimal setup and simple patterns based on the languages you already know (html, css, js).
* **Batteries Included**: For the most common UI & UX patterns & challenges (modals, tabs, toasts, tooltips etc.).

**Who It's For**

* **Existing Rails Developers** who want _even more_ simplicity, and/or more batteries included (solutions to common UI & UX challenges).
* **Developers new to Rails** as the most approachable way to explore Ruby & Rails ideas without getting bogged down in some of the areas with a high learning curve (Importmaps, Hotwire, Stimulus).

**Enhancements & Simplifications**

* Out-of-the-box support for common UI patterns like modals, toasts, tooltips, forms and other UI patterns, powered primarily by [Base Styles](https://github.com/reallygoodsoftware/base-styles).
* **No Build**: By default, we store CSS and javascript libraries in the `/public` folder. This removes an entire category of debugging & deployment complexity.
* **HTMX instead of Hotwire/Turbo**: We also have several best practices docs for how to achieve common UX patterns using HTMX (multi step forms, type to search, etc.)
