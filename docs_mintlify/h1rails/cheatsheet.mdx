**Background**

<Expandable title="Background">
  - Our philosophy is built around the principles written about at [HTML First](https://html-first.com/).
  - You have access to use CSS classes from both **Base Styles** & **Tailwind Lite**.

# **Meta Patterns**

- **Always** follow the "Principle of least power". Use the pattern that requires that least code and the least complexity to get the job done. Some examples:
  - Don't use javascript for interactions that can be achieved with CSS.
  - Don't use custom-written CSS for styles that can be achieved with Base Styles or Tailwind.  

**Pattern Priorities**

1. If you can achieve it by adding an existing class (or classes) from the base-styles library to a new or existing html element.
2. Add an existing class (or classes) from Tailwind Lite to a new or existing html element. 
3. Add minor interactivity by toggling classes on click or change, using Mini JS.
